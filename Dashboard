A user-friendly platform that allows customers to easily view and manage their energy usage, including viewing their current TOU pricing rate and historical usage data.
Advanced algorithms and machine learning models to predict energy demand and adjust the virtual power plant's output in real-time, ensuring a stable and reliable energy supply.
Integration of IoT technology to monitor and control appliances and devices in the home, allowing customers to easily shift their energy usage to off-peak hours and reduce overall demand during peak hours.
A decentralized and autonomous demand response system, leveraging blockchain technology to coordinate and control a network of distributed energy resources (DERs).
A gamification system that incentivizes customers to reduce their energy usage by providing rewards and recognition for achieving certain energy-saving goals.
Inclusion of a direct load control system that allows customers to remotely control certain appliances or devices to reduce their overall energy usage during peak hours.
Integration of real-time pricing, which allows customers to adjust their energy usage in response to changes in the price of electricity.
Dynamic pricing based on the current weather conditions, incentivizing customers to reduce energy usage during high demand times.
Overall, the goal of the decentralized virtual power plant would be to create an efficient and effective demand response system that empowers customers to take control of their energy usage and reduce their overall energy costs.
